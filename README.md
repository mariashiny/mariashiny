**Develop an extensive skill set to break self-learning systems using Python**

## What is this book about?

Cyber security is crucial for both businesses and individuals. As systems are getting smarter, we now see machine learning interrupting computer security. With the adoption of machine learning in upcoming security products, it’s important for pentesters and security researchers to understand how these systems work, and to breach them for testing purposes.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Take an in-depth look at machine learning
* Get to know natural language processing (NLP)
* Understand malware feature engineering
* Build generative adversarial networks using Python libraries
* Work on threat hunting with machine learning and the ELK stack

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
input {
file {
path => "/opt/bitnami/apache2/logs/access_log"
start_position => beginning
}
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for pen testers and security professionals who are interested in learning techniques to break an intelligent security system. Basic knowledge of Python is needed, but no prior knowledge of machine learning is necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
